PerlPP: Perl preprocessor (Modified for SystemRDL)
=========================

Translates **Text+Perl** to **Text**.  
It can be used for any kind of text templating, e.g. code generation.  
No external modules are required, just a single file.

	Usage: perl perlpp.pl [options] [filename]
	Options:
		-o, --output filename    Output to the file instead of STDOUT.
		-e, --eval expression    Evaluate the expression(s) before any Perl code.
		-d, --debug              Don't evaluate Perl code, just write it to STDERR.
		-h, --help               Usage help.

Syntax
------

Syntax is a bit similar to PHP.  
Perl code has to be included between `<%` and `%>` tags.
There are three special modes

	<%=		echo mode, prints a Perl expression
	<%:		command mode, executed by PerlPP itself
	<%/		regular (code) mode with a line break appended to the previous text

A regular mode is started with `<%` followed by any number of whitespaces or line breaks.
If there is any other character after `<%` then this tag will be ignored (passed as it is).

Example
-------

	Hello <% print "world"; %> (again).
	<% for ( my $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++ ) { %>
		number: <%= $i %>
	<% } %>

Result

	Hello world (again).

	number: 0

	number: 1

	number: 2

	number: 3

	number: 4

In order to remove empty lines, one might write it like this

	Hello <% print "world"; %> (again).<%
		for ( my $i = 0; $i < 5; $i++ ) { %>number: <%= $i %>
	<% } %>

Commands
--------

	<%:include file.p %>

or `<%:include "long file name.p" %>` (keep a whitespace between `"` and `%>`, explained further).
Includes source code of another PerlPP file into this position.

	<%:prefix foo bar %>

Replaces word prefixes in the following output.  
In this case words like `fooSomeWord` will become `barSomeWord`.

Capturing
---------

Sometimes it would be great to get (to capture) a text into a Perl string.  

	"%>		start of capturing
	<%"		end of capturing

For example

	<% print "%>That's cool<%" . "%>, really.<%"; %>

is the same as

	<% print 'That\'s cool' . ', really.'; %>

Captured strings are properly escaped, and can be sequenced like in this example.  
Moreover, they can be nested!

	<%
		sub ABC {
			for my $c ( "a".."z" ) {
				print $c;
			}
		}
	%>
	<% ABC(); %>
	<%= uc( "%>alphabet
		<% ABC(); %>
	<%" ); %>

Printed characters from the second `ABC()` call are attached to the string `'alphabet '`,  
so the result will be

	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ALPHABET
		ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Capturing works in all modes: regular, echo or command mode.

Future
------

Suggestions are welcome.

Highlighting
------------

To make PerlPP insets highlighted in Vim, add this to *~/.vimrc*

	autocmd colorscheme * hi PerlPP ctermbg=darkgrey ctermfg=lightgreen

and create corresponding *~/.vim/after/syntax/FILETYPE.vim*

	syntax region PerlPP start='<%' end='%>' containedin=ALL

FILETYPE can be determined with `:set ft?`
